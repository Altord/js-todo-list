# TOP-JS-Todo-List

Inspiration was taken from various online To-Do list programs, trying to make it as minimilistic as possible with plans for more customization in the future.
<br>
What it should be able to do/is planned to do is as follows:
* Add and remove new tasks
* Organize tasks by time and date
* Change the state of tasks and call if a task is overdue
* Add images/bookmarks/links etc. to tasks that render previews
* Change the priority of tasks
* Create minimal "Projects" for further organisation

Future additions will be made in time.
